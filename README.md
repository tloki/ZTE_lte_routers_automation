# ZTE_lte_routers_automation
a project that makes it easy to fetch some data from these routers via python / cli. expecially for A1 versions in Croatia that seem to have broken SMS reader (will wait indefinitelly). Note this is not possible to run remotely by port forwarding as router has it's cross origin policy set to strict.
